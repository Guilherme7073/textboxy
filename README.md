# textboxy scribble
This project is a new version of textboxy, using the [scribble](https://github.com/GameMakerDiscord/scribble/) engine by @jujuadams.  
A small example is included. Please note that this version is not yet ready and considered a preview build or beta.  
There is no real documentation at the moment.  
**Current version: `v1.0.0-pre.1`**

textboxy is built using [GMEdit](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gmedit) and best viewed through it, as namespacing and lambda previews will make navigating the codebase a lot more comfortable.

## Important!
You need to use GameMaker Studio 2 runtime version `2.2.0.261` or lower for scribble to cache the fonts correctly!  
To downgrade a runtime, locate the "Runtime Feeds" menu under `File > Preferences > Runtime Feeds` and click on Master, then select version `v2.2.0.261`. After restarting, clean your cache (`CTRL+F7`). See [this issue](https://github.com/GameMakerDiscord/scribble/issues/3).
