# textboxy scribble
This project is a new version of textboxy, using the [scribble](https://github.com/GameMakerDiscord/scribble/) engine (v2.4.0) by @jujuadams.  
A small example is included. Please note that this version is not yet ready and considered a preview build or beta.  
There is no real documentation at the moment.  
**Current version: `v1.0.0-pre.4`**

textboxy is built using [GMEdit](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gmedit) and best viewed through it, as namespacing and lambda previews will make navigating the codebase a lot more comfortable.

You can now use textboxy with the newest GameMaker Studio 2 runtime version.
